#ofxGuiPlus
Enhaced slider control for openFramworks native ofxGui.

This sliders inherit from the ofxSlider class that is part of ofxGui. As such these are direct replacements.
This sliders allow the user to edit the values by typing or using the arrow keys, thus providing a much more finer control of the values.

###Usage
Check the examples.
Any instance of ofxSlider can be replaced by ofxSliderPlus and it will work.

###Compatibility
Developed using the current head from github, but should work with older versions.
